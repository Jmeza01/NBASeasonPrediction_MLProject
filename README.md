# NBASeasonPredictions - Machine Learning Project
## Technologies Used:
* Machine Learning SkiLearn Regression Classifier Model
* Decision Tree Statistical Model
* Python - Pandas and NumPy

Through our research, we found that the best published model had a prediction accuracy of 74.1% (for playoff outcomes), with most others achieving an upper bound between 66–72% accuracy. Most published research, too, focused on predicting playoff scores — which may lend towards biased data: playoff teams are more consistent in a number of stats throughout the regular season, and playoff game expected outcomes likely experience less variance as a result. Critically, note that the upset rate across the entire season in the NBA averages 32.1%. In the playoffs, the upset rate — as defined by teams with a lower regular season record winning— drops to 22% (which actually means most NBA-playoff prediction models underperform). Because our project looked to predict the outcome of any NBA game and is playoff agnostic, we were looking to develop a model that could reach and hopefully beat a 67.9% accuracy — and in doing so predict some upsets.
